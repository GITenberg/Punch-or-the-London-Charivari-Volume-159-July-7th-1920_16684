<h2>TIMON.</h2>

  <p>About a month ago we lost our dog. I can't describe him, although I
  have tried from time to time; but Elaine, my wife, said I should not
  speak in that fashion of a dumb animal. He stands about two hands high,
  is of a reseda-green shade, except when in anger, and has no
  distinguishing marks except the absence of a piece of the right ear,
  which was carried off by a marauding Irish terrier. He answers with a
  growl to many names, including that of Timon. He will also answer to a
  piece of raw meat, another dog or a postman.</p>

  <p>I do not know if dogs can be said to have a hobby; if so, Timon's
  hobby is postmen. He studies them closely. In fact I should not be
  surprised if he comes to write a monograph on them some day.</p>

  <p>As soon as one of them has daringly passed the entrance gates of
  Bellevue, Timon trots forth like a reception committee to meet him. He
  studies the bunch of communications that the visitor bears in his hand.
  If they are all right&mdash;cheques from publishers, editors and
  missing-heir merchants, invitations to tea and tennis or dinner and
  dominoes, requests for autographs&mdash;Timon nods and allows the postman
  to pass unscathed. On the other hand, if the collection includes rejected
  manuscripts, income or other tax demand notes, tracts or circulars, then
  I hear the low growl with which Timon customarily goes into action, and
  the next moment the postman is making for the neighbouring county and
  taking a four-foot gate in his stride.</p>

  <p>Consequently it is to be anticipated that if the Olympic Games are
  ever held in our neighbourhood the sprint and the hurdles will be simply
  at the mercy of our local post-office. They take no credit for it. It is
  simply practice, they say.</p>

  <p>But, to return to the main subject, we have lost Timon. One month has
  passed without his cheery presence at Bellevue. Reckless postmen have
  made themselves free of the front garden and all colour has gone out of
  life.</p>

  <p>We have done everything to win him back. We have inserted numerous
  advertisements in the agony columns of the newspapers: "If this should
  catch the eye of Timon," or "Come back, Timon. All will be forgiven;" but
  apparently we have yet to find his favourite newspaper.</p>

  <p>We began with the well-known canine papers, trusting vainly that he
  might happen to glance through them some day when he was a bit bored or
  hadn't an engagement. After that we went through <i>The Times</i>, <i>The
  Morning Post</i> (he's strongly anti-Bolshevik), <i>The Daily News</i>
  (his views on vivisection are notorious) and other dailies, and then took
  to the weeklies.</p>

  <p>We had strong hopes for a time that <i>The Meat Trade Review</i> would
  find him. Timon is fond of raw meat. But failure again resulted. We have
  now reached <i>Syren and Shipping</i> and <i>The Ironmongers' Gazette</i>
  and&mdash;</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I must stop here to inform you of the glad news. Elaine has just
  hurried in to tell me that Timon has replied and will be back
  to-morrow.</p>

  <p>How did we catch his eye? Well, of course we should have thought of it
  before. It was <i>The Post Office Gazette</i>.</p>

<h2>THE ROMANCE OF BOOKMAKING.</h2>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">A Visit to Messrs. Pryce Unltd.</font></p>

<p class="center">(<i>With acknowledgments in the right quarter.</i>)</p>

  <p>A gigantic commissionaire flings wide the doors for us and, passing
  reverently inside, we are confronted by the magnificent equestrian statue
  of Mr. Bookham Pryce, the founder of the firm. This masterpiece of the
  Post-Cubist School was originally entitled, "Niobe Weeping for her
  Children," but the gifted artist, in recognition of Mr. Pryce's princely
  offer of one thousand guineas for the group, waived his right to the
  title.</p>

  <p>On the left we see the Foreign Department. Here we watch with rapt
  attention the arrival of countless business telegrams from all parts of
  the world. We choose one or two at random and see for ourselves the
  ramifications of Pryce's far-flung booking service. This one from China:
  "Puttee fifty taels Boko Lanchester Cup;" another from distant Siberia,
  emerging from the primeval forests of that wondrous land of the future:
  "Tenbobski Quitter Ebury Handicap." Bets are accepted in all
  denominations from Victory Bonds to the cowrie-shells of West Africa.</p>

  <p>Passing up the marble staircase and leaving the Home Department on our
  right we arrive at the Stumer Section. Here a small army of ex-Scotland
  Yard detectives are engaged in dealing with <i>malâ-fide</i>
  commissions&mdash;attempts on the part of men of straw to make credit
  bets, or telegrams despatched after a race is over.</p>

  <p>Where shall we go next? We ask a courteous shopwalker, who in flawless
  English advises us to try the Winter Gardens, where a delightful tea is
  served at a minimum cost. Here, whilst sipping a fragrant cup of Orange
  Pekoe, we can watch the large screen, on which the results of all races
  are flashed within ten seconds of the horses passing the winning-post. At
  one time, in fact, it was nothing unusual for Pryce's to have the results
  posted before the horses had completed the course, but in deference to
  the prejudices of certain purists this practice was abandoned.</p>

  <p>Follows a hurried visit to the Library and Museum, where we gaze
  enthralled at the original pair of pigeon-blue trousers with which Mr.
  Bookham Pryce made his sensational <i>début</i> on the Lincoln course in
  the spring of 1894. We might linger here a moment to muse over the simple
  beginnings of great men, but time is pressing and we are all agog to
  visit the Bargain Basement.</p>

  <p>An express lift flashes us downwards in a few seconds and behold we
  are in the midst of rows of counters groaning under bargains that even
  the New Poor can scarce forbear to grasp.</p>

  <p>Here, for example, is one-hundred-to-eight offered against Pincushion
  for the Gimcrack Stakes. This wondrous animal's lineage and previous
  performances are carefully tabulated on a card at the side, and,
  remembering the form he showed at Gatwick, one wonders, as the man in the
  street would say, how it is done.</p>

  <p>Or look at Tom-tom, which left the others simply standing in a field
  of forty-four at Kempton Park, and carrying eight-stone-seven. Here he
  has a paltry four-pound penalty for the Worcester Welter Handicap, yet
  one can have seven to one about him.</p>

  <p>How the House of Pryce can offer such bargains is a mystery to the old
  school of red-necked bookmakers, whose Oxford accent was not pronounced.
  They fail to see what courtesy, urbanity and meat-teas at three shillings
  per head can do in the way of stimulating business.</p>

  <p>From the Bargain Basement we wander at will through the remaining
  departments, making inquiries here and there from the expert assistants,
  technically known as laymen, without being once importuned to make a
  bet.</p>

  <p>And when at length, refreshed and pleased with a delightful afternoon,
  we pass again through the portals of the House of Pryce, we make for
  home, confirmed supporters of the modern personal touch, which has
  transformed a drab business into a veritable romance.</p>

<h2>ELIZABETH GOES TO THE SALES.</h2>

  <p>"Are you goin' to the Summer Sales this year, 'm?" inquired Elizabeth,
  suddenly projecting herself on the horizon of my thoughts.</p>

  <p>I laid down my pen at once. It is not possible to continue writing if
  Elizabeth desires to make conversation at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I shall, if I hear of a sale of cheap crockery," I replied
  pointedly; "ours badly needs replenishing."</p>

  <p>The barbed arrow did not find its mark. It may require a surgical
  operation to get a joke into a Scotsman, but only the medium of some high
  explosive could properly convey a hint to Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"'Oo wants to go to sales to buy things like pots?" asked Elizabeth
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>"<i>People who are always getting their pots broken</i>," I replied in
  italics.</p>

  <p>"Well, everyone to their tastes," she commented casually. I began to
  wonder if even trinitrotoluol could be ineffective at times. "Wot I mean
  by sales is buyin' clothes," she continued; "bargins, you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," I answered; "I've seen them&mdash;in the
  advertisements. But I never secure any."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you, then?"</p>

  <p>"Because of all the other people, Elizabeth. Those who get the
  bargains seem to have a more dominant nature than mine. They have more
  grit, determination&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sharper elbows is wot you mean," put in Elizabeth. "It's chiefly a
  matter of 'oo pushes 'ardest. My! I love a sale if only for the sake o'
  the scrimmage. A friend o' mine 'oo's been separated from 'er 'usband
  becos they was always fightin' told me she never misses goin' to a sale
  so that she'll be in practice in case 'er and 'er old man make it up
  again."</p>

  <p>"I'm not surprised that I never get any bargains," I commented,
  "although I often long to. Look at the advertisement in this newspaper,
  for instance. Here's a silk jumper which is absurdly cheap. It's a lovely
  Rose du Barri tricot and costs only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Oo's rose doo barry trick-o when 'e's at 'ome?" inquired
  Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>I translated hurriedly. "I mean it's a pink knitted one. Exactly what
  I want. But what is the use of my even hoping to secure it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get it for you," announced Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"You! But how?"</p>

  <p>"I'll go an' wait an hour or two afore the doors open, an' when they
  do I don't 'arf know 'ow to fight my way to the counters. Let me go, m'm.
  I'd reelly like the outin'."</p>

  <p>I hesitated, but only for a moment. What could be simpler than sending
  an emissary to use her elbows on my behalf? There was nothing unfair in
  doing that, especially if I undertook the washing-up in her absence.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth set out very early on the day of the sale looking
  enthusiastic. I, equally enthusiastic, applied myself to the menial tasks
  usually performed by Elizabeth. We had just finished a <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> lunch of
  tinned soup, tinned fish and tinned fruit (oh, what a blessing is a
  can-opener in the absence of domestics!) when she reappeared. My heart
  leapt at the sight of a parcel in her hand.</p>

  <p>"You got it after all!" I exclaimed. O thrice blessed Elizabeth! O
  most excellent domestic! For the battles she had fought that day on my
  behalf she should not go unrewarded.</p>

  <p>"I'm longing to try it on," I said as I tore at the outer
  wrappings.</p>

  <p>"Well, I orter say it isn't the one you told me to get," interposed
  Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>I paused in unwrapping the parcel, assailed by sudden misgivings.
  "Isn't this the jumper, then?"</p>

  <p>"Not that pertickler one. You see, it was like this: there was a great
  'orse of a woman just in front o' me an' I couldn't move ahead of 'er
  no'ow, try as I would. It was a case o' bulk, if you know what I mean,
  an' elbows wasn't no good. An' 'ang me if she wasn't goin' in for that
  there very tricky jumper you wanted! I put up a good fight for it, 'm, I
  did indeed. We both reached it at the same time, got 'old of it together,
  an'&mdash;an'&mdash;when it gave way at the seams I let 'er 'ave it,"
  said Elizabeth, concluding her simple narrative. It sounded convincing
  enough. I had no reason to doubt it at the moment.</p>

  <p>"The beast!" I said in the bitterness of my heart. "Is it possible a
  woman could so far forget herself as to behave like that, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"But there's no need for you to be disappointed, as I got a jumper for
  you arter all," she continued. She took the final wrappings off the
  parcel and drew out a garment. "There!" she remarked proudly, holding it
  aloft.</p>

  <p>The Old Masters, we are told, discovered the secret of colour, but the
  colour of that jumper should have been kept a secret&mdash;it never ought
  to have been allowed to leak out. It was one of those flaming pinks that
  cannot be regarded by the naked eye for any length of time, owing to the
  strain it puts on the delicate optic nerve. Bands of purple finished off
  this Bolshevist creation.</p>

  <p>"How dare you ask me to wear that?" I broke out when I had partially
  recovered from the shock.</p>

  <p>"Why, wot's wrong with it? You said you wanted a pink tricky one. It's
  pink, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it <i>is</i> pink," I admitted faintly.</p>

  <p>"An' it's far trickier nor wot the other was."</p>

  <p>"You had better keep the jumper for yourself," I said crossly. "No
  doubt it will suit you better than it would me."</p>

  <p>She seemed gratified, but not unusually taken aback at my generosity.
  "Well, since you ses it yourself, 'm, p'raps it is more my style. Your
  complexion won't <i>stand</i> as much as mine."</p>

  <p>I was pondering on whether this was intended as a compliment or an

<h2>ON WITH THE DANCE.</h2>

  <p>I have been to a dance; or rather I have been to a fashionable
  restaurant where dancing is done. I was not invited to a
  dance&mdash;there are very good reasons for that; I was invited to
  dinner. But many of my fellow-guests have invested a lot of money in
  dancing. That is to say, they keep on paying dancing-instructors to teach
  them new tricks; and the dancing-instructors, who know their business,
  keep on inventing new tricks. As soon as they have taught everybody a new
  step they say it is unfashionable and invent a new one.</p>

  <p>This is all very well from their point of view, but it means that, in
  order to keep up with them and get your money's worth out of the last
  trick you learned, it is necessary during its brief life of
  respectability to dance at every available opportunity. You dance as many
  nights a week as is physically possible; you dance on week-days and you
  dance on Sundays; you begin dancing in the afternoon and you dance during
  tea in the coffee-rooms of expensive restaurants, whirling your
  precarious way through littered and abandoned tea-tables; and at
  dinner-time you leap up madly before the fish and dance like variety
  artistes in a highly-polished arena before a crowd of complete strangers
  eating their food; or, as if seized with an uncontrollable craving for
  the dance, you fling out after the joint for one wild gallop in an outer
  room, from which you return, perspiring and dyspeptic, to the consumption
  of an ice-pudding, before dashing forth to the final orgy at a
  picture-gallery, where the walls are appropriately covered with pictures
  of barbaric women dressed for the hot weather.</p>

  <p>That is what happened at this dinner. As soon as you had started a
  nice conversation with a lady a sort of roaring was heard without; her
  eyes gleamed, her nostrils quivered like a horse planning a gallop, and
  in the middle of one of your best sentences she simply faded away with
  some horrible man at the other end of the table who was probably "the
  only man in London who can do the Double Straddle properly." This went on
  the whole of the meal, and it made connected conversation quite
  difficult. For my own part I went on eating, and when I had properly
  digested I went out and looked at the little victims getting their
  money's worth.</p>

  <p>From the door of the room where the dancing was done a confused uproar
  overflowed, as if several men of powerful physique were banging a number
  of pokers against a number of saucepans, and blowing whistles, and
  occasional catcalls, and now and then beating a drum and several sets of
  huge cymbals, and ceaselessly twanging at innumerable banjoes, and at the
  same time singing in a foreign language, and shouting curses or
  exhortations or street cries, or imitating hunting-calls and the cry of
  the hyena, or uniting suddenly in the war-whoop of some pitiless Sudan
  tribe.</p>

  <p>It was a really terrible noise. It hit you like the back-blast of an
  explosion as you entered the room. There was no distinguishable tune. It
  was simply an enormous noise. But there was a kind of savage rhythm about
  it which made one think immediately of Indians and fierce men and the
  native camps one used to visit at the Earl's Court Exhibition. And this
  was not surprising. For the musicians included one genuine negro and
  three men with their faces blacked; and the noise and the rhythm were the
  authentic music of a negro village in South America, and the words which
  some genius had once set to the noise were an exhortation to go to the
  place where the negroes dwelt.</p>

  <p>To judge by their movements, many of the dancers had in fact been
  there, and had carefully studied the best indigenous models. They were
  doing some quite extraordinary things. No two couples were doing quite
  the same thing for more than a few seconds, so that there was an endless
  variety of extraordinary postures. Some of them shuffled secretly along
  the edge of the room, their faces tense, their shoulders swaying like
  reeds in a light wind, their progress almost imperceptible; they did not
  rotate, they did not speak, but sometimes the tremor of a skirt or the
  slight stirring of a patent-leather shoe showed that they were indeed
  alive and in motion, though that motion was as the motion of a glacier,
  not to be measured in minutes or yards.</p>

  <p>And some in a kind of fever rushed hither and thither among the thick
  crowd, avoiding disaster with marvellous dexterity; and sometimes they
  revolved slowly and sometimes quickly and sometimes spun giddily round
  for a moment like gyroscopic tops. Then they too would be seized with a
  kind of trance, or it may be with sheer shortness of breath, and hung
  motionless for a little in the centre of the room, while the mad throng
  jostled and flowed about them like the leaves in Autumn round a dead
  bird.</p>

  <p>And some did not revolve at all, but charged straightly up and down;
  and some of these thrust their loves for ever before them, as the
  Prussians thrust the villagers in the face of the enemy, and some for
  ever navigated themselves backwards like moving breakwaters to protect
  their darlings from the precipitate seas.</p>

  <p>Some of them kept themselves as upright as possible, swaying slightly
  like willows from the hips, and some of them contorted themselves into
  strange and angular shapes, now leaning perilously forward till they were
  practically lying upon their terrified partners, and now bending sideways
  as a man bends who has water in one ear after bathing. All of them
  clutched each other in a close and intimate manner, but some, as if by
  separation to intensify the joy of their union, or perhaps to secure
  greater freedom for some particularly spacious man&#339;uvre, would part
  suddenly in the middle of the room and, clinging distantly with their
  hands, execute a number of complicated side-steps in opposite directions,
  or aim a series of vicious kicks at each other, after which they would
  reunite in a passionate embrace and gallop in a frenzy round the room, or
  fall into a trance or simply fall down. If they fell down they lay still
  for a moment in the fearful expectation of death, as men lie who fall
  under a horse; and then they would creep on hands and knees to the wall
  through the whirling and indifferent crowd.</p>

  <p>Watching them, you could not tell what any one couple would do next.
  The most placid and dignified among them might at any moment fling a leg
  out behind them and almost kneel in mutual adoration, and then, as if
  nothing unusual had happened, shuffle onward through the press; or, as
  though some electric mechanism had been set in motion, they would
  suddenly lift a foot sideways and stand on one leg. Poised pathetically,
  as if waiting for the happy signal when they might put the other leg
  down, these men looked very sad, and I wished that the Medusa's head
  might be smuggled somehow into the room for their attitudes to be
  imperishably recorded in cold stone; it would have been a valuable
  addition to modern sculpture.</p>

  <p>Upon this whirlpool I embarked with the greatest misgiving and a
  strange young woman clinging to my person. The noise was deafening. The
  four black men were now all shouting at once and playing all their
  instruments at once, working up to the inconceivable uproar of the
  finale; and all the dancers began to dance with a last desperate fury.
  Bodies buffeted one from behind, and while one was yet looking round in
  apology or anger more bodies buffeted one from the flank. It was like
  swimming in a choppy sea, where there is no time to get the last wave out
  of your mouth before the next one hits you.</p>

  <p>Close beside us a couple fell down <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> with a great crash. I looked at
  them with concern, but no one else took any notice. On with the dance!
  Faster and faster the black men played. I was dimly aware now that they
  were standing on their chairs, bellowing, and fancied the end must be
  near. Then we were washed into a quiet backwater, in a corner, and from
  here I determined never to issue till the Last Banjo should indeed sound.
  Here I sidled vaguely about for a long time, hoping that I looked like a
  man preparing for some vast culminating feat, a side-step or a buzz or a
  double-Jazz-spin or an ordinary fall down.</p>

  <p>The noise suddenly ceased; the four black men had exploded.</p>

  <p>"Very good exercise," my partner said.</p>

  <p>"Quite," said I.</p>

<h2>THE KING'S MESSENGER.</h2>

  <p>In Paris Geraldine's mother suggested that, as I was paying a visit to
  London, I could bring Geraldine out with me on the return journey. She
  also suggested that I might bring out a new hat for her (Geraldine's
  mother) at the same time. Though being in love neither with Geraldine's
  mother nor with Geraldine's mother's hat I had to take kindly to both, to
  further my dark designs with regard to Geraldine.</p>

  <p>In London I inspected the hat, complete in box. It was immediately
  obvious that it and I could never make the journey to Paris together. The
  sight of me carrying a hat-box at the early hour of 8 <font
  class="sc">a.m.</font> on Victoria Station would have put Geraldine off.
  Geraldine is very pretty, but she is like that.</p>

  <p>On reflection, the transport of the hat from London to Paris seemed to
  me to be a matter eminently suited to the machinery of our Foreign
  Office. Though the Foreign Officer is as formidable as a Bishop in his
  own cathedral, he is, to those who persist in knowing him personally, a
  man much like oneself, fond of his glass of beer, ready to exchange one
  good turn for another. It happens that I have assisted the F.O. to make
  peace much as I have helped the W.O. to make war. In the sacred precincts
  I reminded my friend of this fact, and impressed upon him that the
  consolidation of the <i>entente</i> between Geraldine and myself was one
  of the most urgent political matters of the day. He was undiplomatic
  enough to ask how he could help ...</p>

  <p>I don't want you to lose your awe of Diplomatic Bags, but there have
  been occasions when the Secret and Confidential Despatch consists of
  little more than a personal note from one strong silent man to another,
  touching on such domestic subjects as, say, a relative's hat. It was
  eventually, if arduously, arranged that in this instance the despatch
  should consist of the hat itself ...</p>

  <p>My fascinating manner of greeting Geraldine on Victoria Station did
  not betray the fact that I had seen that arch-villain, George Nesbitt,
  installed in our train, looking terribly important. George doesn't want
  to marry any girl; every girl therefore wants to marry George. I managed
  to hustle Geraldine into our carriage and get her locked in without her
  seeing George. But George had seen her, and, not knowing that he doesn't
  want to marry any girl and thinking that he wants to marry every girl, he
  firmly convinced himself (I have no doubt) that he was passionately in
  love with Geraldine as he travelled down to Folkestone in his lonely
  splendour.</p>

  <p>On the Channel boat ... but perhaps it is fairer to all parties to
  omit that part.</p>

  <p>At Boulogne I became inextricably mixed up with the Customs' people;
  Geraldine meanwhile got inevitably associated with George Nesbitt. She
  would, of course. Indeed, when at last I scrambled to the Paris train,
  with the cord of my pyjamas trailing from my kit-bag, there was Geraldine
  installed in George's special carriage, very sympathetically studying
  George's passport, wherein all Foreign Powers, great, small and
  medium-sized, were invited in red ink to regard George as It.</p>

  <p>George informed me that, being a King's Messenger, he was afraid he
  dare not trust me, as a mere member of the public, to travel in the same
  carriage as the Diplomatic Bag. I said I must stay with them and keep an
  eye on Geraldine. George said that he would do that. In that case, I
  said, I would stay and keep an eye on the Diplomatic Bag. Geraldine being
  at one end of the carriage and the bag being at the other end George
  could not very well keep an eye on both. The possibility of George's eyes
  wandering apart when he was off his guard made a fleeting impression on
  Geraldine in my favour. I stayed.</p>

  <p>George then set about to make the most of himself. Geraldine abetted.
  Geraldine is a terror. I became more determined than ever to marry her,
  George and the <font class="sc">King</font> notwithstanding. George
  however got going. "For a plain fellow like myself" (he knows how
  confoundedly handsome he is) "it has been some little satisfaction to be
  selected as a Special Courier."</p>

  <p>I explained the method of selection as I guessed it. "He forced his
  way into the F.O. and in an obsequious tone, which you and I, Geraldine,
  would be ashamed to adopt, begged for the favour of a bag to carry with
  him. If the <font class="sc">King</font> had known about it he would
  rather have sent his messages by post."</p>

  <p>"The general public," said George to Geraldine, "is apt to be very
  noisy and tiresome on railway journeys, is it not?"</p>

  <p>Geraldine acquiesced. She doesn't often do that, but when she does it
  is extremely pleasant for the acquiescee. I pressed on with my
  explanation desperately. "I can hear poor old George pleading in a broken
  voice that he had to get to Paris and dared not go by himself. So they
  listened to his sad story and gave him a bag to see him through, and it
  isn't George who is taking the bag to Paris, but the bag which is taking
  George." To prevent him arguing I told Geraldine that you can tell a real
  K.M. by his Silver Greyhound badge, which he'll show you if you doubt
  him, just as you can tell a stockbroker by his pearl tie-pin, which you
  can see for yourself. This put George on his mettle.</p>

  <p>"To think that to me are entrusted messages which may alter the map of
  Europe and change the history of the world! But I mustn't let my conceit
  run away with me, must I?" Positively I believe Geraldine at that began
  to play with the idea of doing what George said he mustn't let his
  conceit do. Anyhow I had half-an-hour to myself while she listened to the
  inner histories of European Courts and flirted with the Bearer of
  Despatches. I was left gazing at the bag.</p>

  <p>There was only one bag, but it was very bulky. The contents were a
  tight fit; something round, about a yard in diameter, about a foot and a
  half in depth.</p>

  <p>"Are you looking after this bag of yours properly, George?" I asked.
  "We shall be very angry with you if you go and lose it." Something
  indefinable but intensely important in my tone caught Geraldine's
  attention.</p>

  <p>"That is between me and the F.O.," said George irritably.</p>

  <p>"When I was talking to them about it&mdash;" said I.</p>

  <p>"What have you to do with the Foreign Office?" asked Geraldine.</p>

  <p>"Little enough," I said modestly. "I have my own business to see to.
  But the F.O. have always wanted to have something to do with me. So I
  gave them the job of looking after your mother's hat. Had I known that
  they would send it along by any Tom, Dick or George who happened to drop
  in and offer to take the bag&mdash;"</p>

  <p>George snatched the bag, examined it hastily and then tried to conceal
  it behind his own luggage. But Geraldine knows enough about hats to be
  able to spot a hatbox, when put to it, through all the heavy canvas and
  all the fancy labels in the world. So there was nothing more to be said
  about it; and there was little more to be done about it except for George
  to go on doing special messenger with it. The inner histories died down
  and, after a brief silence, George affected to go to sleep.</p>

  <p>I only woke him up once and that was to ask whether he cared to look
  after the rest of my luggage for me.</p>

  <p>When we got to Paris I explained to George that I had not meant to
  hurt his feelings; there was no fellow I would more gladly entrust my odd
  jobs to. Indeed Geraldine and I should want him to officiate in a similar
  capacity at the coming ceremony.</p>

  <p>A very satisfactory conclusion. I got Geraldine; Geraldine got her
  full <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
  deserts&mdash;me; and if George had the misfortune to sit on the bag in
  the taxi, what matter? Geraldine had acquiesced; after that who cared
  what Geraldine's mother did, said, thought or wore?</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Monday, June 28th.</i>&mdash;Less than thirty years ago the
  prophets of ill foresaw ruin for the British shipping trade if the dock
  labourers got their "tanner." The "tanner" has now become a florin, and
  this afternoon the Peers passed without a dissentient voice the Second
  Reading of a Bill to enable Port and Harbour authorities to pay it.</p>

  <p>They were much more critical over the Increase of Rent Bill, and at
  the instance of Lord <font class="sc">Midleton</font> defeated by a two
  to one majority the Government's proposal to deprive landlords of the
  power to evict strikers in order to provide accommodation for men willing
  to work. But the Government got a little of their own back on the clause
  authorising an increase of rent on business premises by forty per cent.
  Lord <font class="sc">Salisbury</font> wanted seventy-five per cent. and
  haughtily refused Lord <font class="sc">Astor's</font> sporting offer of
  fifty, but on a division he was beaten by 25 to 23.</p>

  <p>In the Commons Sir <font class="sc">Frederick Hall</font> complained
  that slate and slack were still being supplied to London consumers under
  the guise and at the price of coal. What was the Government going to do
  about it? Mr. <font class="sc">Bridgeman</font> replied that control
  having been removed the Government could do nothing, and consumers must
  find their own remedy&mdash;a reply which drove Sir <font
  class="sc">Frederick</font> into such paroxysms of indignation that the
  <font class="sc">Speaker</font> was obliged to intervene.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Kiley's</font> gloomy vaticinations as to the
  disastrous effect of the Plumage Bill on British commerce met with no
  encouragement from Sir <font class="sc">Robert Horne</font>. In his
  opinion, I gather, our foreign trade is quite safe, and the Bill will not
  knock a feather out of it.</p>

  <p>To Viscount <font class="sc">Curzon's</font> inquiry whether the
  Allies were going to proceed with the trial of the <font
  class="sc">ex-Kaiser</font> the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> at
  first replied that he had "nothing to add." On being twitted with his
  election-pledge he added a good deal. When he gave that pledge, it seems,
  he did not contemplate the possibility that Holland would refuse to
  surrender her guest, and he had no intention of using force to compel
  her. <font class="sc">William Hohenzollern</font>, he considered, was not
  worth any more bloodshed. In that case the Government would save a good
  deal of Parliamentary time if they were definitely to write him off with
  their other bad debts.</p>

  <p>Among other methods of brightening village life the Ministry of
  Agriculture has lately circulated "rules for the mutual insurance of pigs
  and cows." The intellectual development of our domestic animals evidently
  proceeds apace. We have all heard of the learned pig, but that the cow
  also should be deemed capable of conducting actuarial calculations does,
  I confess, surprise me.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Having heard the latest feat of the Sinn Feiners in kidnapping a
  British General, the House evidently considered that it had better hurry
  up with the Government of Ireland Bill. Clauses 51 to 69 were run through
  in double-quick time. Only on Clause 70, providing for the repeal of the
  Home Rule Act of 1914, did any prolonged debate arise. Captain <font
  class="sc">Wedgwood Benn</font> pleasantly described this as the only
  clause in the Bill that was not nonsense, and therefore moved its
  omission. He was answered by the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font>,
  who declared that no Irishman would now be content with the Act of 1914,
  and defended the present Bill on the curious ground that it gave Ireland
  as much self-government as Scotland had ever asked for. Sir <font
  class="sc">Edward Carson's</font> plea that it was a case of "this Bill
  or an Irish Republic" was probably more convincing. In a series of
  divisions the "Wee Frees" never mustered more than seventeen votes. The
  author of the Act of 1914, Mr. <font class="sc">Asquith</font>, was not
  present at the obsequies.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, June 29th.</i>&mdash;The establishment of a "National
  home" for the Jewish race in Palestine aroused the apprehensions of Lord
  <font class="sc">Sydenham</font> and other Peers, who feared that the
  Moslem inhabitants would be exploited by the Zionists, and would
  endeavour to re-establish Turkish rule. Lord <font
  class="sc">Curzon</font> did his best to remove these impressions.
  Authority in Palestine would be exercised by Great Britain as the
  Mandatory Power, and the Zionists would not be masters in their "national
  home," but only a sort of "paying guests." The confidence felt in Sir
  <font class="sc">Herbert Samuel's</font> absolute impartiality as between
  Jews and Arabs was such that a high authority had prophesied that within
  six months the High Commissioner <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
  id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> would be equally unpopular with both
  races.</p>

  <p>In the Commons Mr. <font class="sc">Baldwin</font> explained that the
  Inland Revenue Authorities were taking all possible steps to collect
  income-tax in Ireland despite the obstacles placed in their way by the
  local authorities. Whereupon Sir <font class="sc">Maurice
  Dockrell</font>, in his richest brogue, summarised the Irish situation as
  follows: "Is not the difficulty that they do not know which horse to
  back?"</p>

  <p>A Bill "to continue temporarily the office of Food Controller" was
  read a first time. The House would, I think, be sorry to part with Mr.
  <font class="sc">McCurdy</font>, whose replies to Questions are often
  much to the point. He was asked this afternoon, for example, to give the
  salaries of three of his officials, and this was his crisp reply: "The
  Director of Vegetable Supplies serves the Ministry without remuneration;
  the post of Deputy-Director of Vegetable Supplies does not exist, and
  that of Director of Fish Supplies has lapsed."</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Bonar Law</font> shattered two
  elaborately-constructed mare's-nests when he announced that the
  appointment of a British Ambassador to Berlin was made in pursuance of an
  agreement arrived at in Boulogne on the initiative of the French
  Government, and that Lord <font class="sc">D'Abernon's</font> name was
  suggested by the <font class="sc">Foreign Secretary</font>. I am not
  betraying any confidence when I add that it will be no part of Lord <font
  class="sc">D'Abernon's</font> new duties to establish a Liquor Control
  Board on the Spree.</p>

  <p>The Overseas Trade (Credits and Insurance) Bill was skilfully piloted
  through its Second Reading by Mr. <font class="sc">Bridgeman</font>. The
  House was much pleased to hear that only nine officials would be required
  to administer the twenty-six millions involved, and that their salaries
  would not exceed seven thousand pounds a year&mdash;although two of them
  were messengers.</p>

  <p>But this temporary zeal for economy quickly evaporated when the
  Pre-War Pensions Bill made its appearance. Member after Member got up to
  urge the extension of the Bill to this or that deserving class, until Sir
  <font class="sc">L. Worthington-Evans</font> pointed out that, if their
  demands were acceded to, the Bill, instead of costing some two millions a
  year, would involve three or four times that amount.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, June 30th.</i>&mdash;The Lords discussed, in whispers
  suitable to the occasion, the Official Secrets Bill. As originally drawn
  it provided that any person retaining without lawful authority any
  official document should be guilty of a misdemeanour. But, thanks to the
  vigilance of Lords <font class="sc">Burnham</font> and <font
  class="sc">Riddell</font>, this clause, under which every editor in Fleet
  Street might have found himself in Holloway, was appreciably softened.
  Even so, the pursuit of "stunts" and "scoops" will be a decidedly
  hazardous occupation.</p>

  <p>The Press Lords were again on the alert when the Rents Bill came on,
  and objected to a clause giving the <font class="sc">Lord
  Chancellor</font> power to order proceedings under the measure to be held
  in private. This time the <font class="sc">Lord Chancellor</font> was
  less pliant, and plainly suggested that the newspapers were actuated in
  this matter by regard for their circulations. Does he really suppose that
  the disputes of landlords and tenants will supply such popular "copy" as
  to crowd out the confessions of Cabinet Ministers?</p>

  </div>
  <p>Constant cross-examination on the Amritsar affair, involving the
  necessity of framing polite replies to thinly-veiled suggestions that
  <font class="sc">Montagu</font> rhymes with <font
  class="sc">O'Dwyer</font>, is making the <font class="sc">Secretary of
  State for India</font> a little restive. The tone in which he expressed
  his hope that the promised debate would not be much longer delayed
  distinctly suggested that his critics would then be "for it."</p>

  <p>Two days ago the <font class="sc">Minister of Transport</font>
  expounded in a White Paper his elaborate plan for redistributing and
  co-ordinating the activities of the railway companies&mdash;the North
  Eastern excepted&mdash;and directing them all from an office in
  Whitehall. By the Ministry of Mines Bill it is proposed to treat the
  mines in much the same way. Sir <font class="sc">Eric Geddes'</font>
  scheme has yet to run the gauntlet of Parliamentary criticism. Sir <font
  class="sc">Robert Horne's</font> had its baptism of fire this afternoon,
  and a pretty hot fire it was. Miners like Mr. <font
  class="sc">Brace</font> cursed it because it did not go all the way to
  Nationalisation; coal-owners like Sir <font class="sc">Clifford
  Cory</font>, because it went too far in that direction. The voice of the
  mere consumer, who only wants coal cheap and plentiful, was hardly heard.
  The second reading was carried, but by a majority substantially less than
  the normal.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, July 1st.</i>&mdash;Unfortunately the House of Lords does
  not contain a representative of Sinn Fein and therefore had no
  opportunity of learning the opinion of the dominant party in Ireland
  regarding Lord <font class="sc">Monteagle's</font> Dominion of Ireland
  Bill. Other Irish opinion, as expressed by Lords <font
  class="sc">Dunraven</font> and <font class="sc">Killanin</font>, was that
  it would probably cause the seething pot to boil over. Lord <font
  class="sc">Ashbourne</font> made sundry observations in Erse, one of
  which was understood to be that "Ireland could afford to wait." The Peers
  generally agreed with him, and, after hearing from the <font
  class="sc">Lord Chancellor</font> that of all the Irish proposals he had
  studied this contained the most elements of danger, threw out the Bill
  without a division.</p>

  <p>"A sinecure, whose holder is in receipt of a salary of five thousand
  pounds per annum," was Mr. <font class="sc">Bonar Law's</font>
  description of his office as Lord Privy Seal. The House rewarded the
  modesty of its hard-working Leader with laughter and cheers. None of his
  predecessors has excelled him in courtesy and assiduity; as regards
  audibility there is room for improvement. Mr. <font class="sc">Law</font>
  rarely plays to the Gallery; but he might more often speak in its
  direction.</p>

<h2>THREE EXCEPTIONAL MEN.</h2>

  <p>"If these men are types, how London has changed!" I said to myself.
  But can they be? I fear not; I fear that "exceptional" is the only word
  to use. Yet it was very remarkable to meet them all on the same day,
  Friday, June 25th.</p>

  <p>The first was on an omnibus. A big man with a grey beard who was alone
  on the seat. Several other seats had only one passenger; the
  rest&mdash;mine among them&mdash;were full. At Westminster came up a
  youth and a girl who very obviously were lovers. Owing to the disposition
  of the seats they had to separate, the girl subsiding into the place
  beside the big man immediately in front of me. At first he said nothing,
  and then, just as we were passing the scaffolding of the Cenotaph, he did
  something which proved him to be very much out of the common, a creature
  apart. Reaching across and touching the youth on the shoulder, he said,
  "Let me change places with you. I expect you young people would like to
  sit together."</p>

  <p>That was exceptional, you will agree. He was right too; the young
  people did like to sit together. I could see that. And the more the
  omnibus rocked and lurched the more they liked it.</p>

  <p>The second exceptional man was a taxi-driver. I wanted to get to a
  certain office before it shut, and there were very few minutes to do it
  in. The driver did his best, but we arrived just too late; the door was
  locked.</p>

  <p>"That's a bit of hard luck," he said. "But they're all so punctual
  closing now. It's the daylight-saving does it. Makes people think of the
  open-air more than they used."</p>

  <p>As I finished paying him&mdash;no small affair, with all the new
  supplements&mdash;he resumed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you had the journey for nothing," he said. "It's rough. But
  never mind&mdash;have something on Comrade for the Grand Prix" (he
  pronounced "Prix" to rhyme with "fix") "in France on Sunday. I'm told
  it's the goods. Then you won't mind about your bad luck this afternoon.
  Don't forget&mdash;Comrade to win and one, two, three."</p>

  <p>After this I must revise my opinion of taxi-drivers, which used not to
  be very high: especially as Comrade differed from most racehorses of my
  acquaintance by coming in first.</p>

  <p>The third man perhaps was more unexpected than exceptional. His
  unexpectedness took the form not of benevolence but of culture. He is a
  vendor of newspapers. A pleasant old fellow with a smiling weather-beaten
  face, grey moustache and a cloth cap, whom I have known for most of the
  six years during which he has stood every afternoon except Sundays on the
  kerb between a lamp-post and a letter-box at one of London's busiest
  corners. I have bought his papers and referred to the weather all that
  time, but I never talked with him before. Why, I cannot say; I suppose
  because the hour had not struck. On Friday, however, we had a little
  conversation, all growing from the circumstance that while he was
  counting out change I noticed a fat volume protruding from his coat
  pocket and asked him what it was.</p>

  <p>It was his reply that qualified him to be numbered among Friday's
  elect. "That book?" he said&mdash;"that's <i>Barchester Towers</i>."</p>

  <p>I asked him if he read much.</p>

  <p>He said he loved reading, and particularly stories. <font
  class="sc">Marie Corelli</font>, <font class="sc">Ouida</font>, he read
  them all; but <font class="sc">Trollope</font> was his favourite. He
  liked novels in series; he liked to come on the same people again.</p>

  <p>"But there's another reason," he added, "why I like <font
  class="sc">Trollope</font>. You see we were both at the Post Office."</p>

  <p>Some day soon I am going to try him with one of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Walkley's</font> criticisms.</p>

<h2>PRISCILLA PAINTS.</h2>

  <p>"There was a lot of men in the boat," said Priscilla from behind the
  table, where she sat daubing with little energetic grunts.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there were, were there?" I answered from behind <i>The
  Times</i>.</p>

  <p>Confident of arousing my enthusiasm in the end, she continued to issue
  tantalising bulletins about the progress of the great work.</p>

  <p>"It was an all-colour boat," she told me, "purple and yellow and
  green."</p>

  <p>"A very nice kind of boat too," I agreed.</p>

  <p>"And the biggest man of all hadn't got <i>any</i> body at all."</p>

  <p>I suggested weakly that perhaps the biggest man of all had left his
  body behind on the table at home. The suggestion was scorned.</p>

  <p>"No, he hadn't never had any body at all, <i>this</i> man," she
  replied. And then, as my interest seemed to be flagging again, "They all
  had <i>very</i> rosy faces; and do you know why they had?"</p>

  <p>"I don't, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"Because they'd eaten up all their greens."</p>

  <p>Vanquished at last, I went over to visit the eupeptic voyagers. Seven
  in all, they stood in their bright boat on a blue sea beneath a round and
  burning sun. Their legs were long and thin, their bodies globular (all
  save one), and their faces large. They were dressed apparently in light
  pink doublets and hose, and on his head each wore a huge purple turban
  the shape of a cottage loaf, surmounted by a ragged plume. They varied
  greatly in stature, but their countenances were all fixed in the same
  unmeaning stare. Take it all in all, it was an eerie and terrible
  scene.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see how the boat moves along, Priscilla," I said; "it
  hasn't any oars or sail."</p>

  <p>It was a tactless remark and the artist made no reply. I did my best
  to cover my blunder.</p>

  <p>"I expect the wind blew very hard on their feathers," I said, "and
  that drove them along."</p>

  <p>"What colour is the wind?" inquired Priscilla.</p>

  <p>She had me there. I confessed that I did not know.</p>

  <p>"It was a brown wind," she decided, impatient at my lack of resource,
  and slapped a wet typhoon of madder on the page. There was no more doubt
  about the wind.</p>

  <p>"And is the picture finished now?" I asked her.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't finished. I haven't drawn the pookin yet."</p>

  <p>The pookin is a confusion in the mind of Priscilla between a pelican
  and a toucan, because she saw them both for the first time on the same
  day. In this case it consisted of an indigo splodge and a long red bar
  cutting right through the brown wind and penetrating deeply into the
  yellow sun.</p>

  <p>"It had a <i>very</i> long beak," observed Priscilla.</p>

  <p>"It had," I agreed.</p>

  <p>I am no stickler for commonplace colours or conventional shapes in a
  work of art, but I do like things to be recognisable; to know, for
  instance, when a thing is meant to be a man and when it is meant to be a
  boat, and when it is meant to be a pookin and when it is meant to be a
  sun. The art of Priscilla seems to me to satisfy this test much better
  than that of many of our modern <i>maestri</i>. Strictly representational
  it may not be, but there are none of your whorls and cylinders and angles
  and what nots.</p>

  <p>But I also insist that a work of art should appeal to the imagination
  as well as to the eye, and there seemed to me details about this picture
  that needed clearing up.</p>

  <p>"Where were these men going to, Priscilla?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They was going to Wurvin," she answered in the tone of a mother who
  instructs her child. "And what do you think they was going to do
  there?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"They was going to see Auntie Isabel."</p>

  <p>"And what did they do then?"</p>

  <p>"They had dinner," she cried enthusiastically. "And do you know what
  they did after dinner?"</p>

  <p>"I don't."</p>

  <p>"They went on the Front to see the fire-escape."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me now that the conception was mellow, rounded and
  complete. It had all the haunting mystery and romance of the sea about
  it. It was reminiscent of the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>. It savoured of the
  books of Mr. <font class="sc">Conrad</font>. It reminded me not a little
  of those strange visitations which come to quiet watering-places in the
  novels of Mr. <font class="sc">H.G. Wells</font>. When I thought of those
  seven men&mdash;one, alas, disembodied&mdash;so strangely attired yet so
  careful of elementary hygiene, driven by that fierce typhoon, with that
  bird of portent in the skies, arriving suddenly with the salt of their
  Odyssey upon their brows at the beach of the genteel and respectable
  Sussex town, and visiting a perhaps slightly perturbed Auntie Isabel, and
  afterwards the fire-escape, I felt that here was the glimpse of the wild
  exotic adventure for which the hearts of all of us yearn. It left the
  cinema standing. It beat the magazine story to a frazzle.</p>

  <p>"And who is the picture for, Priscilla?" I asked, when I had
  thoroughly steeped myself in the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"It's for you," she said, presenting it with a motley-coloured hand;
  "it's for you to take to London town and not to drop it."</p>

  <p>I was careful to do as I was told, because I have a friend who paints
  Expressionist pictures, and I wished to deliver it at his studio. It
  seems to me that Priscilla, half-unconsciously perhaps, is founding a new
  school of art which demands serious study. One might call it, I think,
  the Pookin School.</p>

<h3>WHEN CHARL. COMES OVER.</h3>

  <p>It is said that Mr. <font class="sc">Charles Chaplin</font>, a
  prominent citizen of Los Angeles, Cal., has employed the greater part of
  the last few days in mopping his brow, sighing with relief and exclaiming
  "Gee!"</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Chaplin</font> declares that missing the boat for
  England recently was the narrowest escape from death he has ever enjoyed.
  But for having been thus providentially prevented from visiting his
  native land in the company of Miss <font class="sc">Mary Pickford</font>
  and Mr. <font class="sc">Douglas Fairbanks</font> (better known as "<font
  class="sc">Mary</font>" and "<font class="sc">Doug.</font>" respectively)
  he would have come back to the dear homeland all unprepared for what
  would surely have happened to him no less than it happened to his
  illustrious colleagues in the film world.</p>

  <p>Since his promised visit to our shores cannot long be delayed, he has
  already begun elaborate preparations for travelling in safety. He is
  growing a large beard and is learning to walk with his toes turned in. A
  number of his teeth will be blackened out during the whole of his
  European tour, and his hair will be kept well-ironed and cropped
  short.</p>

  <p>He has engaged a complete staff of plain-clothes pugilists to travel
  with him everywhere and to stand on guard outside his bathroom door. They
  will also surround him during meal-times to prevent admirers from
  grabbing his food to hand down to their children as heirlooms.</p>

  <p>He is being measured for a complete outfit of holeproof clothing, and
  his motor will be a Ford of seventeen thicknesses, with armoured steel
  windows, and fitted with first-aid accessories, including liniment,
  restoratives and raw steak. His entourage will include a day doctor, a
  night doctor, a leading New York surgeon and a squad of
  stretcher-bearers.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested to him that a further precaution would be not to
  advise the Press of the date of his arrival; but that he considers would
  be carrying his safety-first measures to a foolish extreme.</p>

<h3>A TRAGEDY OF REACTION.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>It was a super-poet of the neo-Georgian kind</p>
      <p>Whose fantasies transcended the simple bourgeois mind,</p>
      <p>And by their frank transgression of all the ancient rules</p>
      <p>Were not exactly suited for use in infant schools.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>But, holding that no rebel should shrink from fratricide,</p>
      <p>His gifted brother-Georgians he suddenly defied,</p>
      <p>And in a manifesto extremely clear and terse</p>
      <p>Announced his firm intention of giving up free verse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The range of his reaction may readily be guessed</p>
      <p>When I mention that for Browning his devotion he confessed,</p>
      <p>Enthroned above the <font class="sc">Sitwells</font> the artless Muse of "<font class="sc">Bab</font>,"</p>
      <p>And said that <font class="sc">Marinetti</font> was not as good as <font class="sc">Crabbe</font>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>At first the manifesto was treated as a joke,</p>
      <p>A boyish ebullition that soon would end in smoke;</p>
      <p>But when he took to writing in strict and fluent rhyme</p>
      <p>His family decided to extirpate the crime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Two scientific doctors declared he was insane,</p>
      <p>But likely under treatment his reason to regain;</p>
      <p>So he's now in an asylum, where he listens at his meals</p>
      <p>To a gramophone recital of the choicest bits from <i>Wheels</i>.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>Whatever else may be said about Mr. <font class="sc">Arthur
  Compton-Rickett</font> as a novelist, it can at least be urged for him
  that he displays no undue apprehension of the too-facile laugh. For
  example, the humorous possibilities (or perils) in the plot of <i>The
  Shadow of Stephen Wade</i> (<font class="sc">Jenkins</font>) might well
  have daunted a writer of more experience. <i>Stephen Wade</i> was an
  ancestor, dead some considerable time before the story opens,
  and&mdash;to quote the old jest&mdash;there was no complaint about a
  circumstance with which everybody was well satisfied. The real worry over
  <i>Stephen</i> was twofold: first, that in life he had been rightly
  suspected of being rather more than a bit of a rip, and secondly that his
  grandson, <i>Philip</i>, the hero of the story, had what seemed to him
  good cause for believing that <i>Stephen's</i> more regrettable
  tendencies were being repeated in himself. Here, of course, is a theme
  capable of infinite varieties of development; the tragedies of heredity
  have kept novelists and dramatists busy since fiction began. The trouble
  is that, all unconsciously, Mr. <font class="sc">Compton-Rickett</font>
  has given to his hero's struggles a fatally humorous turn.
  <i>Philip's</i> initial mistake appeared to be the supposition that
  safety could be secured by flight. But it has been remarked before now
  that Cupid is winged and doth range. <i>Philip</i> dashed into the depths
  of Devonshire, only to discover that even there farmers have pretty
  daughters; seeking refuge in the slums he found that the exchange was one
  from the frying-pan to the fire. In short, <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> there was no peace for him,
  till the destined heroine.... Well, you can now see whether you are
  likely to be amused, edified, or bored by a well-meaning story, told (I
  should add) with a rather devastating solemnity of style.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>M. <font class="sc">Henri Domelier</font>, the author of <i>Behind the
  Scenes at German Headquarters</i> (<font class="sc">Hurst and
  Blackett</font>), must also be accounted among the prophets, for he
  foretold the invasion of Belgium. Before the War he edited a newspaper in
  Charleville, and when the Ardennes had been "inundated by the enemy
  hordes" and the local authorities had withdrawn to Rethel, he stayed in
  Charleville and acted as Secretary to the Municipal Commission. This
  organisation was recognised by the Germans, but to be secretary of it was
  still a dangerous post, and M. <font class="sc">Maurice Barrès</font> in
  eloquent preface tells us of some of the sufferings that M. <font
  class="sc">Domelier</font> had to endure while trying to carry out his
  difficult duties. The French who remained in Charleville had more than
  ample opportunities of seeing both the <font class="sc">ex-Kaiser</font>
  and his eldest son, and M. <font class="sc">Domelier</font> writes of
  them with a pen dipped in gall. No book that I have read puts before one
  more poignantly the miseries which the inhabitants of invaded France had
  to bear during "the great agony." For the most part they bore them with a
  courage beyond all praise; but some few, giving way under stress of
  physical suffering or moral temptation, forgot their nationality; and
  these M. <font class="sc">Domelier</font> makes no pretence to spare. I
  think that even those of us who have definitely made up our minds
  regarding the Hun and want to read no more about him will welcome this
  book. For if it is primarily an indictment of Germans and German methods,
  it is hardly less a tribute to those who held firm through all their
  misery and never gave up hope during the darkest days.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I have before now met (in books) heroes who wore dungaree and had as
  setting an engineer-shop or a foundry, but never one who equalled <i>Jim
  Robinson</i> (<font class="sc">Hutchinson</font>) in the strictness of
  his attention to business. <i>Jim</i> is the managing director of
  <i>Cupreouscine, Limited</i>, a firm which deals in a wonderful copper
  alloy which he himself has invented, and the book tells the story of his
  long and losing fight against the other directors, who are all in favour
  of amalgamation with another and much larger concern. Sketched in so few
  words the book's subject sounds unattractive, but Miss <font
  class="sc">Una L. Silberrad</font> has a genius for making "shop" as
  interesting in her novels as it usually is in real life, and <i>Jim's</i>
  plans and enterprises and the circuitous ways of the other directors
  provide material for quite an exciting story. When I say "other
  directors," <i>Mary Gore</i>, representing a brother on the board of
  <i>Cupreouscine</i> and backing <i>Jim</i> through thick and thin to the
  limit of her powers, must be excepted. In spite of her gracious reserve
  and self-possession, it is plain that <i>Mary</i> loves the busy managing
  director; but <i>Jim's</i> feelings are more difficult to fathom. In fact
  he is so long in mentioning his passion that it is quite a relief when,
  on the last page but one, what publishers call the "love interest"
  suddenly strengthens and their engagement is announced, very suitably and
  to her entire satisfaction, to the charwoman at the foundry.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Open the Door</i> won the two hundred and fifty pounds prize
  offered by Messrs. <font class="sc">Melrose</font>, and without troubling
  to inquire into the merits of its rivals I wholeheartedly commend the
  award. For some curious reason its length (one hundred and eighty
  thousand words&mdash;no less) is insisted upon by the publishers, but as
  a matter of fact Miss <font class="sc">Catherine Carswell's</font> novel
  would have been even more remarkable if it had been of a less generous
  bulk. Her style is beyond reproach and she has nothing whatever to learn
  in the mysteries of a woman's heart. The principal scenes are placed in
  Glasgow, and the <i>Bannermann</i> family are laid stark before us.
  <i>Mrs. Bannermann</i> was so intent on the next world that for all
  practical purposes she was useless in this. Having been left a widow with
  two sons and two daughters, she was incapable of managing the easiest of
  them, let alone such an emotional complexity as <i>Joanna</i>. It is upon
  <i>Joanna</i> that Miss <font class="sc">Carswell</font> has concentrated
  her forces; but she is not less happy in her analysis of the many lovers
  who fell into the net of this seductive young woman. Indeed I have not
  for many a day read a novel of which the psychology seemed to me to be so
  thoroughly sound.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I hope "Miss <font class="sc">M.E. Francis</font>" will take it as a
  compliment when I say that <i>Beck of Beckford</i> (<font
  class="sc">Allen and Unwin</font>) should form part of the holiday
  equipment of all of us whose brows are not too exalted to enjoy it. In
  her unostentatious way Miss <font class="sc">Francis</font> knows how to
  provide ample entertainment, and she has nothing to learn in point of
  form. When we are introduced to the <i>Becks</i> they are proud and poor,
  having impoverished themselves in the process of removing a blot from
  their escutcheon. <i>Sir John</i> is a working farmer, and <i>Lady
  Beck</i> does menial duties with an energy that most servants of to-day
  would not care to imitate. The apple of their old eyes is their grandson,
  <i>Roger</i>, and the story turns on his struggle between pride and love.
  No true Franciscan need be told that he comes through his struggle, with
  flying colours. So quietly and easily does the tale run that one is apt
  to overlook the art with which it is told. But the art is there all the
  time.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
